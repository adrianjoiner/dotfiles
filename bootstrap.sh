# Script for setting up a new OSX machine
# 
# Apps not included due to no cask being available
#
# Notes:
#
# - If installing full Xcode, it's better to install that first from the app
#   store before running the bootstrap script. Otherwise, Homebrew can't access
#   the Xcode libraries as the agreement hasn't been accepted yet.
